# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of State Testing data for the PyCity School District. 

## Overview of the school district analysis
In this analysis, we looked at the state testing outcomes for the PyCity School Distric. We calculated the aveage math and reading scores for each school site, as well as the passing rates for each section of the test, and the overall passing rate. We determined the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools in the district. We further broke down the data into categories in order to compare performance between schools based on a number of variables including the amount spent per student, school size, and type of school (charter or district). After the initial analysis, there became some question of the reliability of the data from the Thomas High School 9th grade class. In order to correct for these possible issues, we stripped the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School, and re-ran the analysis with the corrected data. 

## Results: 
Taking out the 9th grade Thomas High Shcool test scores changed the data for the analysis. Luckily the deletion of the compromised data did not change the outcomes of our original analyis in any significant way. In our analysis, the DataFrames that summarized our findings were rounded to the nearest whole number. When the compromised data was take out of our data set, the values in our analyses were changes are hundreths of a point, which did not shift in any direction enough to change our whole number values. 

- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type

## Summary:
