Analysis of State Testing data for the PyCity School District. 

## Overview of the school district analysis
In this analysis, we looked at the state testing outcomes for the PyCity School District. We calculated the average math and reading scores for each school site, as well as the passing rates for each section of the test, and the overall passing rate. We determined the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools in the district. We further broke down the data into categories in order to compare performance between schools based on a number of variables including the amount spent per student, school size, and type of school (charter or district). After the initial analysis, there became some question of the reliability of the data from the Thomas High School 9th grade class. In order to correct for these possible issues, we stripped the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School and replaced them with blank, Nan values. Then, we re-ran the analysis with the corrected data. 

## Results: 
Taking out the 9th grade Thomas High School math and reading test scores changed the data for the analysis. Luckily the deletion of the compromised data did not change the outcomes of our original analysis in any significant way. In our analysis, the DataFrames that summarized our findings were rounded to the nearest whole number. When the compromised data was taken out of our data set, the values in our analyses were changed only hundredths of a point, which did not shift in any direction enough to change our whole number values in the summary. After the values were rounded to the nearest whole number, the district summary and the Thomas High School summary both contained the same values are the original summaries performed on the compromised data.

Replacing the 9th grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School with NaN values did not change the ranking of the schools relative to one another. Thomas High School remained the 2nd top performing school behind Cabrera High School and above Griffin High School.

Additionally, replacing the ninth-grade scores did not affect any of the following relative to the original analysis: 
  - Math and reading scores by grade: 
	These appear to show that scores across the 9th â€“ 12th grade students do not vary greatly within each school. 

  - Scores by school spending: 
	These appear to show that higher scores on the exams tend to be more associated with being in the lower spending ranges. 

  - Scores by school size: 
	These appear to show that larger schools are more likely to be associated with lower test scores. 

  - Scores by school type: 
	These appear to indicate that District schools had lower passing rates than the Charter schools in the district.

## Summary: 
In this analysis, we removed the math and reading test scores and replaced them with blank, NaN values for Thomas High School in the PyCity Schools District Analysis. This was requested after there was some suspicion of the academic integrity of the scores of these students. After the 9th grade scores were removed, the analysis was performed again. There were no changes in the overall outcomes of the analysis when these suspect values were removed. The ranking of Thomas High School was not altered relative to the other schools and the overall percentages for Thomas High School were not changed when rounded to the nearest whole value. 

This is good news for the both the school and the district that the possibly compromised scores did not change the analysis. This indicates that the 9th grade scores were not a significant factor in the performance of Thomas High School in the original analysis. The school and district can feel confident that the original analysis is reflective of what is shown in the data and that the possible academic integrity issues did not affect the scores or analysis in any significant way.
